Schematic outline 

arduino will have software to read from various sensors 
	temperature 
	humidity 
	soil moisture 
	light level
 
if temp too high
	fan()
if humidty too low
	mist()
if soil moisture too low
	water()
if light level too high
	shade() 

most important is water()

	this will requrie pump of some sort 

arduino will record variables over time into log files 

graphes will be produced to give insight into temperature/humidity/light 
level effect on soil moisture
