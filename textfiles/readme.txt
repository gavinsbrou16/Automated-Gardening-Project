Recently I've developed a likeing to gardening. There's something nice
about planting some seeds, watching them grow, and learning from my mistakes

I've watched a couple of videos online about how to set up a self watering
system for a home garden. I'm going to start on this project in hopes that 
I'm able to finish and get a working product.

Firstly, I need to draw up some blueprints. This ranges from hardware to 
software. In terms of hardware, we will need:

	arduino 
	various sensors 
	valves
	hoses 
	etc(TBD)

In terms of software, we will use a basis found on github. 

I want my software to be able to utilize the various sensors and gather data
to make some cool graphs
